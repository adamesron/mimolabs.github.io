              <h3>How MIMO has helped us sell more cakes!</h3>
              <p>We've had guest WiFi for years but it never did anything for us. After installing MIMO, we've seen a <b>massive increase in repeat business</b>.</p>
              <p>MIMO connected directly to our existing equipment. It took us less than 2 minutes to set up all our stores! I created a really slick splash page that matches our brand and added email capture.</p>
              <p>The reports really help us understand customer loyalty. Most importantly however, it helps us segment all our users - we can personally connect with each individual user. Automatically!</p>
              <p><b>My favourite feature is the campaigns tool</b>. We run a few marketing campaigns. MIMO automatically:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Emails a coupon to customers who've visited more than 10 times</li>
                <li>Sends a welcome email when they first login and use the WiFi</li>
                <li>Sends out an email if they've not been back for a while</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We can see the delivery stats too - our email list has never been this clean! <b> We highly recommend you try MIMO today!</b></p>
            </span>
            <span class="hide-for-medium">
              <p>With MIMO I can capture emails, understand whoâ€™s coming back and send automated newsletters.</p>
