          <p>There was a strange company called <a href="https://www.ct-networks.io">Cucumber Tony</a>. Tony was a cloud-based management tool for WiFi access points. Cucumber Tony helped lots of companies around the world with their WiFi networks.</p>
          <p>As Tony grew, lots of people started asking him for fancy pants email campaigns to go with his fancy pants splash pages.</p>
          <p>But Tony didn't do fancy pants email campaigns. Troubled by this ü§î Tony sat down and did some thunking. Then..... one cold winters day, Tony decided to create a new product called MIMO. </p>
          <p>MIMO would use lots of the clever tools that Tony had made. And MIMO would wrap these up to neat little packages that everyone can use. And Tony also decided to make MIMO work on other kinds of devices, like UniFi and Ruckus ones.</p>
          <p>And that's the story of MIMO „äóÔ∏è</p>
