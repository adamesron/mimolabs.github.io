      <p>Once upon a time, a company called <a href="https://www.ct-networks.io">Cucumber Tony</a> released a cloud-based tool to help IT resellers manage their WiFi networks.</p>
      <p>As Tony grew, businesses started asking him for fancy pants email campaigns to go with his splash pages.</p>
      <p>But Tony didn't do fancy pants email campaigns. Troubled by this ðŸ¤” Tony decided to create a new product called MIMO to fill the gap.</p>
      <p>And that's the story of MIMO - built by the same dedicated team that built Cucumber Tony ðŸ¥’ in London.</p>
