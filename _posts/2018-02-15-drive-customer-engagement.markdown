# Using WiFi to Drive Engagement

We've compiled a few tips and tricks to help you get more out of your WiFi.

WiFi's pretty popular these days. Maybe your cafe, bar, hotel or chop house has some Free WiFi goodness.

But what's your WiFi actually doing for you? Most of the time it works fine. Sometimes it goes wrong. People complain. You worry about illegal downloaders and worse, free loaders. But you've got to have it. It's a must.

Here's a few inside tips to make your WiFi work for you. You can read the results of a survey we recently conducted in a forthcoming article.

## It's only a splash page...

No it's not. Most people trust free public WiFi more when there's a splash page. Particularly when it's pretty (and better still, branded).

A handsome splash page makes a **big difference**. First impressions count right? It's not so hard to create a pretty one these days.

## Don't ask, don't get

Can you capture good quality data via a splash page? TLDR; People don't actually mind entering their email!

We recently ran an experiment to measure the quality of the data captured via a splash page. We ran the tests in 20 locations, evenly split:

- Group A used a registration login with name, age, location and email.
- Group B used a simple splash with just email capture (like the one above).

**The results are in.....**

- 3% of the emails captured on the registration page were legit. I.e. not many people entered a valid email.
- 86% of the emails captured on the simple splash were legit. Woooah!

Take a step back, these results are ridiculous. People *are* happy to enter their details as long as you're careful:

1. Don't ask for too much data
2. Give them the choice to opt-out
3. Offer something back

In the above experiment, we offered each user a free coffee if they entered their email. That's the real reason they entered their email ðŸ˜˜

## Careful Targeting

So, it's easy to create a handsome splash page in a flash. It's also possible to capture good quality emails. And, it's possible to automatically add these emails to a list, like MailChimp or Campaign Monitor.

If you're going to capture emails from a splash page, make sure you put them in their very own list. Don't just add them to one massive list.

Think about it, knowing which customers have actually visited you is gold. Your standard list will be full of spam, users from far away lands etc. Your splash list is for customers who've actually been in. **That's a big deal**.

## Automate your emails

So, you've got the splash, you got the email. You got a list. You're kind of a big deal! What's next? You could send a monthly newsletter to everyone. Or:

1. You could send a spontaneous email to your customers who've visited more than 5 times in the last 30 days
2. You could send another email to those who've not been back for over a month

Be smarter with your campaigns - personalise things. With MIMO you can schedule emails to go out automatically. You make a small effort once and the return will be mega. Don't spam your regular guests with desperate 'come back' messages.

## Be a human

Don't send emails from some rubbish 'no-reply@my-cafe.london' address. Make them personal, send them from a real person. And wait for the replies - answer them too. Your customers will appreciate this. A lot.

The customers you really want are the ones that really want to engage.

## Respect

Some people just don't want to engage with you. That's business (and life). Let them unsubscribe. Simple as that.
