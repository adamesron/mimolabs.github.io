# Preparing for GDPR

May 25th is looming and there’s still a lot of speculation about the __General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)__. We thought it would be useful to compile a checklist of things you absolutely must do if you’re running a retail store, cafe, hotel or other public facing business.

If you’re offering WiFi in your stores, you’re already collecting personal data in the form of user MAC addresses - the unique identifier of every internet connected device. If you’re not collecting them, your provider will be (and probably collects a lot more too).

Depending on how your WiFi is setup, you may need to add some additional terms to your site. If it’s operated by a third-party, the responsibility for the data lies with them.

Here’s checklist to help ensure you’ll be ok by the 25th:

1. Ensure your WiFi provider (this could be you) has implemented GDPR ‘friendly’ terms on their site.
2. Add your own terms, sub-processors and cookie policies to your site.
3. Add an opt-in checkbox wherever you’re capturing customer data, including emails.
4. Add a cookie consent form to your site (and splash pages).
5. Determine if you’re a controller or processor of the data.

# Whose responsibility is it?

What you need to do depends on how you’ve setup your splash pages and who operates them.

If they’re 100% operated by a third-party, like MIMO for example, the end-user’s relationship is with the provider. It is therefore their responsibility to include GDPR friendly terms on their site (and splash pages). If the third party shares customer data with you, they must explain so within their terms.

If you’re using your own self-hosted or rebranded splash pages, the user is interacting with your business. It’s therefore your responsibility to include the relevant terms on your site.

Under __Article 15 of the GDPR__, your customers have the right to request confirmation as to whether or not their personal data are being processed. They can also request this data and information about where the data’s stored.

If you’re running your own splash pages, your customers can contact you and request any data you have about them. As the controller of the data, it’s your responsibility to answer your customer’s questions.

If you’re using a third-party, the user should contact them directly.

To be safe, we’d recommend including a section on your own site that details who you use as a sub-processor.

Whether you’re providing your own WiFi or use a third-party, you must be able send the user and data they request and be able to delete them completely. You can read about <a href="https://oh-mimo.com/gdpr-wifi-tools/" target="_blank">MIMO’s GDPR tools here.</a>

### Newsletter Signup Example

You’ve included an email form on your site or splash pages. The emails are added directly to your MailChimp account.

Firstly, the form should include a consent checkbox - the user must opt-in to receiving marketing emails.

Your terms should clearly state you’re using MailChimp as a processor.

If you receive a data request from a customer, you need to be able to send them the data they’ve requested.

And if they request a deletion, you must be able to delete them directly from MailChimp. No personal data can be left behind - anonymous stats are ok. There’s a great article about this <a href ="https://blog.mailchimp.com/gdpr-tools-from-mailchimp/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Who is the controller and who is the processor?

__Article 4__ defines the controller and processor as follows:

<div class="blog-quote">
<p><b>‘controller’</b> means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;</p>
<p><b>‘processor’</b> means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller;</p>
</div>

So... what?

For example, if you sell coffee to consumers and use MIMO Inc. to capture customer emails via splash pages with your logo, email consumers on your behalf and track activity, then regarding such email data, you are the data controller. MIMO is the data processor.

And then __article 28(1)__ states that:

<div class="blog-quote">
<p>Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this Regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject.</p>
</div>

Which means - data controllers, i.e. customers of data processors (you), can only use processors that comply with the GDPR, or risk penalties themselves.

Make sure you’re using a reputable, compliant provider otherwise you will be punished.

### What is personal data?

__TLDR__; anything that can potentially be linked to a user.

From the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/key-definitions/" target="_blank">main GDPR site</a>:

<div class="blog-quote">
<p>The GDPR applies to ‘personal data’ meaning any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier.</p>
<p>This definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data, including name, identification number, location data or online identifier, reflecting changes in technology and the way organisations collect information about people.</p>
</div>

### How the data can be processed

The GDPR requires that personal data shall be processed lawfully and fairly.

__TLDR__; whoever’s collecting the data can’t use it for naughty reasons, nor can they sell it without consent / pre-warning.

The data that’s gathered must be:

- Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;
- Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;
- Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;
- Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;
- Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed;
- Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

## Common Questions

#### Do I need to add a double-opt in when capturing customer emails

You don’t need to add a double opt-in but you do need to add a single opt-in. Adding a double opt-in is an optional extra step that can’t hurt.

#### Do I need to contact my existing customer base to re-establish consent

  Technically no as long as they’ve given consent before. However, it’s good practice to do so. We’re recommending all our customers do this with their existing lists.

__Whilst we’re excellent at providing WiFi services, we’re not lawyers so we must insist you get a second opinion.__
