    <h2>MIMO Official Launch</h2>

    <p>The MIMO team has been busy working away to get everything ready and launched for you guys. And today we are happy to announce that MIMO is officially live!</p>

    <p>We appreciate all the interest you guys expressed while we were in our closed beta testing, so we are super excited to open it up to you all.</p>

    <h3>What is MIMO?</h3>

    <p>MIMO is not just a typical splash page provider. MIMO is a splash page engagement platform designed for SMBs, letting you engage with your customers through your WiFi.</p>

    <p>On top of allowing you to create some stunning splash pages, MIMO allows you to really get to know who your customers are. It provides you with the tools needed to create campaigns designed to target your customer base and improve customer retention & loyalty.</p>

    <h3>What can I do with MIMO?</h3>
    <p>MIMO allows you to get integrated with your access points in a matter of minutes.</p>

    <p>From there you just need to design your fully responsive splash page and select a login type; anything from a simple Clickthrough Login to Social Login and even Paid Access.</p>

    <p>If you're on the Engage plan you can create yourself a campaign to make use of all the valuable data you're capturing and help drive retention and customer loyalty. You can even track your campaign progress by monitoring open and click rates, allowing you to improve and refine target your campaigns.</p>

    <h3>How much will MIMO cost me?</h3>
    <p>Pay only for what you use! You're charged based on the products you choose, and the number of people under your account.</p>

    <p>There are no additional costs per access point, and no restrictions based on your splash views or sessions</p>
