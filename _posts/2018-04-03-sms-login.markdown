Enabling SMS OTP logins is as simple as heading into the new splash editor, and ticking the SMS box under login types! There's no need to worry about having to set up your own SMS service, we handle all of that for you.

Guests simply tap the SMS button, provide their phone number, and are then sent a one time password that they can use to log in. Quick and easy, just as it should be.

Please be aware that SMS usage is charged seperately to your subscribed plan. <a href="https://docs.oh-mimo.com/splash-pages/sms-messages-otp" target="_blank">See here for more information.</a>
