# Splash Popup Advertisement

Our brand new splash page popup advertisement allows you to display an image to a guest before they log in. Now you can show an advert before they log in (with the popup advert) and/or after they log in (with our splash welcome page)!

<div class="blog-image">
  <img src='/images/posts/splash-adverts.gif'>
  <p style="color: #ddd; font-size: 12px;">How to access the advertisement options</p>
</div>

Simply upload the image you want to display and this feature will be enabled for you. The new popup will be shown to the guest for 5 seconds before they are able to dismiss the popup, giving them time to read your message!
