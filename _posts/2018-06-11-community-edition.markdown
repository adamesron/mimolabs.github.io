# MIMO Community Edition

We're quite excited to introduce the MIMO Community Edition to you all.

The community edition is essentially a standalone version of MIMO that you can install and host yourselves - something customers have been asking us about for quite a while.

It gives you everything you need to run your own self-hosted splash pages!

Oh, and it's completely free. That's right - __Free.__

You'll have the option to brand your dashboard with your own logos, link your own documents and we'll even generate you your own set of terms.

You can also link your own Intercom or Drift support tools to the dashboard, letting you support your users.

Setup and installation, while requiring some technical knowledge, is relatively quick and easy.
