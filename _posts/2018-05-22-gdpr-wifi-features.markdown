# It's GDPR Time!

You heard it from us first (I'm sure you didn't) - the GDPR party is happening on Friday 25th May 2018.

We've written loads of blogs and updates which include the features we've added etc. We're overdue a summary - here's some useful articles etc:

1. Common questions we've been asked — blog > <a href='https://blog.ct-networks.io/common-questions-about-gdpr-7c6a26bb167c' target='_blank'>here</a>.
2. The six things you must do — another blog > <a href='https://oh-mimo.com/blog/preparing-for-gdpr.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.
3. Ensure you've enabled the consent form on your splash pages — doc <a href='https://docs.oh-mimo.com/splash-pages/using-the-consent-form' target='_blank'>here</a>.
4. Read about the new GDPR tools we've implemented — blog <a href='https://www.oh-mimo.com/blog/gdpr-features-special.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.
5. Read our terms — they're actually quite interesting — <a href='https://oh-mimo.com/terms' target='_blank'>here</a>.

<b>If you're in the EU - please please please ensure you've enabled the consent checkbox on your splash pages.</b>

We've add loads of features to keep you and your customers safe. These include:

- Customisable consent popup
- User timelines
- Double-opt-in emails
- Personalised user data request tools!
- Heck, we even moved our service into the EU completely
