            <h4>You charge for people, what are people?</h4>
            <p>Everyone with a unique ID in your MIMO account counts towards the total number of people in your account at any one time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns faqs">
            <h4>What if a person has multiple devices?</h4>
            <p>Where possible, we'll bundle them together under one ID so you only pay for a single person. You can also manually merge people too.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns faqs">
            <h4>What happens when I delete some people?</h4>
            <p>If you delete some people, you'll be billed less next month assuming you've dropped into a lower tier. You don't need to do anything else.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns faqs">
            <h4>Can I try both plans during the 14 day trial?</h4>
            <p>Sure you can. We recommend you try the Engage Plan first because it's pretty freaking awesome.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns faqs">
            <h4>What do you mean by emails?</h4>
            <p>Emails are outbound messages that are sent when events occur. You can create campaigns that send your messages when your customer first connects or if they don't come back for a while.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns faqs">
            <h4>How many emails can I send?</h4>
            <p>On the Engage Plan, you get 100,000 emails included every month. That's a lot. If you go over, you can hop onto the Engage Plus Plan. It's unlikely you'll go over though.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns faqs">
            <h4>Do you offer discounts?</h4>
            <p>No we don't, everyone gets the same great deal.</p>

          <div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns faqs">
            <h4>How many access points can I add?</h4>
            <p>As many as you freaking want. There are no additional costs for APs.</p>
