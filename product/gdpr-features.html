            <h3>GDPR Friendly Splash Pages</h3>
            <p>Even if you're not using the built-in email capture, you're capturing personal data in the form of IP & MAC addresses. The GDPR says that you must obtain explicit, opt-in consent, and be clear about how your customer data will be used.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>GDPR friendly splash pages that are fast to set-up. You'll be able to get (and record) your user's consent.</li>
              <li>Automatically add a checkbox so your users can decide what to sign-up for.</li>
              <li>Control SMS & Email notification settings separately.</li>
              <li>Automatically control the cookie & privacy policy.</li>
              <li>Control the text and add your own terms.</li>
              <li>Disable access completely if they don't provide consent or opt-out.</li>

            <h3>Customer Timeline</h3>
            <p>You also need to give your users a facility to view, download and delete their profile data.</p>
            <p>We’ve built you a whole new section so you can search and browse through your customers. We’re calling them — timelines!</p>
            <p>When the user agrees to the terms, the action is now logged into their timeline so you and they can see when they agreed and what they agreed to, as well as tracking all of your messages to them.</p>

            <h3>Double Opt-In Email Capture</h3>
            <p>To keep you GDPR compliant when you use internal integration with your Email login type, your guests will now be sent an email upon signing in to confirm that they agree to their email being used for newsletters/marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>Their email will not show in your lists until they confirm this.</p>
